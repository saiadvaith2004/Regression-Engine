Designed a machine learning web application to predict outcomes using regression techniques. It is built in multiple phases, each improving upon the previous in terms of accuracy, generalizability, and technical depth.

1) Developed a car price prediction model using Multiple Linear Regression and integrated into a user-friendly Flask web app.
2) Enhanced the model to work with global datasets by allowing flexible feature and target selections. Added feature engineering like squared features and improved prediction accuracy.
3) Generalized the system by enabling it to handle global datasets with categorical and numerical features.
4) Formulated a process to understand the error rates in real world datasets by mimicking it with Synthetic AI generated data there by helping to better test the ML models and improve data accuracy

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
